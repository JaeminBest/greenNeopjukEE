Description
----------------
KAIST safety-team still use human-power for handling traffic and crosswalk. Therefore, we suggest deep-learning based traffic handling system.
We used YOLONET for object(human,car,ducks) detection and adversarial neural etwork for traffic handling. We also compare this adversarial NN with our handmade algorithm.
